# Iosevka-Dynamo
Adding programming ligatures from [FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) to my favorite [Iosevka](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka) font.

## Why do I create it?
Although Iosevka has ligatures, but it's not work with my kitty terminal (https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/297).
And FiraCode has some ligatures that I need.

## Which version of font that I use?
FiraCode v4 has infinite-length that I don't want to use and has some bugs on kitty (https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/issues/1081).
So I will use FiraCode v3.1 for my font.
> ![NOTE]
> TODO: I will try to get some ligatures in higher version to my font in the future.

## Requirements
This script requires FontForge to build font. AFAIK, you can must `python-fontforge` (Debian/Ubuntu or ArchLinux) or `fontforge` (Gentoo, OpenSUSE).
